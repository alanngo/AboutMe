            Hello! My name is Alan Ngo. As of May 23 2020, I have graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's Degree in
            Computer Science. My college career began in August 2015, when I attended Austin Community College. 
            There, I took the prerequisites needed to enter in to the program. Since then, my interests in computers grew
            in both the hardware and software areas. Because of that, I became more familiar with programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python in addition to 
            <a href="pc.html"><b>building the computer</b></a> that I would be running those programs on. Thanks to some help from college friends, and <b><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips">Linus</a></b>, 
            I was able to build my own setup which I use for programming, gaming, surfing the internet and watching movies. Since then, I seek to sharpen my skills in both 
            hardware and software aspects to where I can teach others how to do the same. Sharing skills with others not only benefits me in the sense that I get to share 
            my knowledge with someone else. It also benefits the people that recieve my knowledge because it can save them headaches and frustrations within the learning 
            process. As part of "passing the torch", I have uploaded some <a href="refsheets.html"><b>useful reference guides</b></a> needed to suceed not just in school, 
            but also in industry.
