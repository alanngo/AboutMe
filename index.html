            My Name is Alan Ngo, I am currently a student at UT Austin, persuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.My college career started in August 2015, when 
            I started attending Austin Community College. There I took the prerequesites needed to enter in to the program. Since then, my intersts in computers grew
            in both the hardware and software areas. Because of that, I became more familiar with programming languages such as C++, Java and Python, in addition to 
            <a href="pc.html">building the computer</a> that I would be running those programs on. Thanks to some help from college friends, and Linus, I was able to build my own setup which 
            I use for programming, gaming, surfing the internet and watching movies. Since then, I seek to sharpen my skills in both hardware and software aspects to where
            I can teach others how to do the same.
