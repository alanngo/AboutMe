            My name is Alan Ngo, I am currently a student at UT Austin, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. My college career started in August 2015, when 
            I started attending Austin Community College. There I took the prerequesites needed to enter in to the program. Since then, my intersts in computers grew
            in both the hardware and software areas. Because of that, I became more familiar with programming languages such as C++, Java and Python, in addition to 
            <a href="pc.html"><b>building the computer</b></a> that I would be running those programs on. Thanks to some help from college friends, and Linus, I was able to build my 
            own setup which I use for programming, gaming, surfing the internet and watching movies. Since then, I seek to sharpen my skills in both hardware and 
            software aspects to where I can teach others how to do the same. This sort of learning not only benefits me in the sense that I get to share my knowledge 
            with someone else. It also benefits the people that recieve my knowledge because it can save them headaches and frustrations within the learning process. 
            As of May 23, 2020, I have graduated UT Austin. As part of my graduation gift, I have put a link to some <a href="refsheets.html"><b>useful reference guides</b></a> 
            needed to suceed not just in school, but also in industry.
