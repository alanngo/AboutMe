            My name is Alan Ngo, I have graduated UT Austin with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science as of May 23 2020. My college career began in August 2015,  
            when I attednded Austin Community College. There I took the prerequesites needed to enter in to the program. Since then, my intersts in computers grew
            in both the hardware and software areas. Because of that, I became more familiar with programming languages such as C++, Java and Python, in addition to 
            <a href="pc.html"><b>building the computer</b></a> that I would be running those programs on. Thanks to some help from college friends, and Linus, I was 
            able to build my own setup which I use for programming, gaming, surfing the internet and watching movies. Since then, I seek to sharpen my skills in both 
            hardware and software aspects to where I can teach others how to do the same. This sort of learning not only benefits me in the sense that I get to share 
            my knowledge with someone else. It also benefits the people that recieve my knowledge because it can save them headaches and frustrations within the learning 
            process. As part of "passing the torch", I have uploaded some <a href="refsheets.html"><b>useful reference guides</b></a> needed to suceed not just in school, 
            but also in industry.
